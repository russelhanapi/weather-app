## How It Works

1. **User Input**: The user enters the name of a city into the input field and presses Enter.
2. **Weather Fetching**: The app makes a request to the WeatherCrossing API to fetch weather data for the specified city.
3. **Displaying Results**: The app displays the weather details (temperature, feels like, condition) and a corresponding weather icon.
4. **Loader**: A loader is shown while waiting for the weather data to be fetched, and the results are displayed once the data is ready.
